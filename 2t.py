1. The high accuracies per branch (0.90, 0.69, etc.) but zero precision/recall suggest that our model is just predicting 0 for each branch
2. For each branch individually:
   - If NBA12 is 0 in 90.6% of cases, and we predict all 0s, we get 0.906951 accuracy
   - Similarly for NBA3: if it's 0 in 69.6% of cases, predicting all 0s gives 0.696657 accuracy
   - And so on...

3. Val Acc: 0.8571 was because val_acc = eval_results['branch_metrics']['accuracy'].mean()

By taking means of all branch accuracy
(0.906951 + 0.696657 + 0.664904 + 0.921841 + 0.926648 + 0.930158 + 0.952841) / 7 â‰ˆ 0.8571

This is incorrect because:
1. Each sample should have exactly one NBA=1 (from data preprocessing)
2. If model predicts all zeros, it should be wrong for every sample
3. True accuracy should be 0% if predicting all zeros
