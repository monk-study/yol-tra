Performance Comparison for our Workload:

1. V100 vs T4:
```
V100 advantages:
- 3-4x faster training speed
- Better for large batch sizes
- More CUDA cores (5120 vs 2560)

T4 advantages:
- Lower cost
- Newer architecture
- Better inference performance
```

2. Memory Requirements Analysis:
```
Your workload:
- Dataset: ~741K samples Ã— 54 features
- Batch sizes: 32-128
- Multiple model configs

Minimum recommended:
- 16GB GPU memory
- 8+ vCPUs
- 112GB+ system RAM
```

Cost-Performance Recommendation:

1. Development Phase:
```
NC6s_v3 (1x V100)
Justification:
- Faster training than T4
- Sufficient memory for your models
- Good for AutoML experimentation
```

2. Production Training:
```
NC12s_v3 (2x V100)
Justification:
- Parallel training capability
- Faster AutoML iterations
- Better cost/performance ratio than 4x V100
```

3. Budget Option:
```
NC4as_T4_v3
Justification:
- Lowest cost
- Still capable of handling your workload
- Good for initial development
```

Azure ML Configuration Tips:

```python
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute
from azureml.core.compute_target import ComputeTargetException

compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(
    vm_size='NC12s_v3',  # 2x V100
    min_nodes=0,
    max_nodes=4,
    idle_seconds_before_scaledown=1800,
    enable_node_public_ip=True
)

# For AutoML configuration
automl_config = AutoMLConfig(
    compute_target=compute_target,
    task='classification',
    primary_metric='accuracy',
    enable_early_stopping=True,
    max_concurrent_iterations=4,  # Adjust based on GPU count
    experiment_timeout_hours=3
)
```

Cost Optimization Strategies:
1. Use low-priority VMs when possible (50-80% cost savings)
2. Implement auto-scaling
3. Schedule workloads efficiently
4. Monitor GPU utilization
